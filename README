Zanzibar

What?
Zanzibar is a soundboard application. Its name is a homage to the Halo 2
multiplayer map of the same name. The multiplayer map featured a large
structure facing a vast sea. This coastal structure is one of my favorite maps
in one of my favorite series. The application is what I have called a
"SEABoard" (it's a synonym for coast!), which stands for "Sound Effect
Aggregation" Board.

Where?
The source code is hosted on a public repo in github.
git clone git@github.com:SirBraneDamuj/Soundboard.git

When?
Version 1.0 of the application will be finished by the end of the winter term
at Drexel University (so like...March something).

Why?
www.instantsfun.es inspired me to write this program. I love the site, but I
find myself wanting to add more sound effects. So I decided to make an
application that lets me do a custom one.

How?
Swing for GUI
JLayer for mp3 playback
