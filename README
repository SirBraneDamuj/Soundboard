Zanzibar

What?
Zanzibar is a soundboard application. Its name is a homage to the Halo 2
multiplayer map of the same name. The multiplayer map featured a large
structure facing a vast sea. This coastal structure is one of my favorite maps
in one of my favorite series. The application is what I have called a
"SEABoard" (it's a synonym for coast!), which stands for "Sound Effect
Aggregation" Board.

Where?
The source code is hosted on a public repo in github.
git clone git@github.com:SirBraneDamuj/Soundboard.git

When?
Current version is v0.1. I will pick up development on the application after my
winter term at Drexel (around April).

Why?
www.instantsfun.es inspired me to write this program. I love the site, but I
find myself wanting to add more sound effects. So I decided to make an
application that lets me do a custom one.

How?
Swing for GUI
JLayer for mp3 playback
