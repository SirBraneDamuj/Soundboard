1. What is Soundboard?

Soundboard is a java project designed to create a one-window collection of
buttons that are linked to some sound file. The idea is for the user to create
a directory of sound clips and auto-generate a window with all of those sounds
available at the click of a button.

2. What does it use?

Soundboard is developed using SWT and jlayer.
